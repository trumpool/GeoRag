❓ QUERY: How does hypertension affect Alzheimer's disease risk?
======================================================================

💡 ANSWER:
[31055733_sent_2] Hypertension is one of the AD risk factors that has been linked to underlying pathological changes like senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation as well as hippocampal atrophy.

❓ QUERY: What genes are associated with AD and what are their biological functions?
======================================================================

💡 ANSWER:
[30448613_sent_2] The identified and/or confirmed 19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AD are located on non-coding DNA regions, and their functional impacts on AD are as yet poorly understood. [31055733_sent_7] The chromosomal regions corresponding to four genes (i.e., 2p13.1, 9p13.3, 17q12, and 18q21.1) were not associated with AD at P  5E-06 in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). [31055733_sent_5] The closest genes to 14 polymorphisms were not associated with AD at P  5E-06 in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). [31055733_sent_7] The IGAP SNPs in ABCA7, CD2AP, and CD33 each acted as eQTL for AD-associated genes in brain.

❓ QUERY: What are the findings from genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's?
======================================================================

💡 ANSWER:
Our genome-wide association analyses revealed significant associations of 15 novel potentially AD-associated polymorphisms (P  5E-06) that were located outside the chromosome 19q13 region and were significant either in hypertensive or non-hypertensive groups
