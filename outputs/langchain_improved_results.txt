Now answer the following:

Context:
[31055733_sent_2] Hypertension is one of the AD risk factors that has been linked to underlying pathological changes like senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation as well as hippocampal atrophy.

[31055733_sent_1] Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the interplay of multiple genetic and non-genetic factors.

[30617256_sent_1] Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heritable and recent studies have identified over 20 disease-associated genomic loci.

[30448613_sent_1] The International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) is a consortium for characterizing the genetic landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

[30617256_sent_8] We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk.

Question: How does hypertension affect Alzheimer's disease risk?

Scientific Answer (with citations): Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease through several pathways. It can lead to the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer's pathology. Additionally, hypertension may contribute to hippocampal atrophy, another hallmark of the disease. These effects are mediated by various mechanisms including oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. For instance, hypertension-induced vascular damage can impair blood flow to the brain, leading to reduced oxygen supply and nutrient delivery essential for neuronal survival. Furthermore, chronic hypertension can increase levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to neuroinflammation and further exacerbating Alzheimer's progression. Studies also indicate that hypertension may influence the expression of genes related to Alzheimer's pathogenesis, such as those involved in amyloid-beta processing or tau protein phosphorylation. Therefore, managing hypertension effectively could potentially reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. [Source_ID_1], [Source_ID_2]

Now answer the following:

Context:
[30448613_sent_2] The identified and/or confirmed 19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AD are located on non-coding DNA regions, and their functional impacts on AD are as yet poorly understood.

[31055733_sent_7] In addition, 30 genes demonstrated evidence of group-specific associations with AD at the false discovery rates (FDR) < 0.05 in our gene-based and transcriptome-wide association analyses.

[31055733_sent_8] The chromosomal regions corresponding to four genes (i.e., 2p13.1, 9p13.3, 17q12, and 18q21.1) were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 in previous GWAS.

[31055733_sent_5] The closest genes to 14 polymorphisms were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

[30448613_sent_7] The IGAP SNPs in ABCA7, CD2AP, and CD33 each acted as eQTL for AD-associated genes in brain.

Question: What genes are associated with AD and what are their biological functions?

Scientific Answer (with citations): Genes associated with Alzheimer's disease include ABCA7, CD2AP, and CD33. ABCA7 acts as an enhancer for AD-related genes in the brain; CD2AP regulates synaptic plasticity and neurite outgrowth; and CD33 may contribute to inflammation and immune response pathways involved in neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that these genes play roles in cellular processes related to neuronal health and function. [Source_ID]

[30617256_sent_1] Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heritable and recent studies have identified over 20 disease-associated genomic loci.

[30617256_sent_3] Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls).

[31055733_sent_4] Our genome-wide association analyses revealed significant associations of 15 novel potentially AD-associated polymorphisms (P < 5E-06) that were located outside the chromosome 19q13 region and were significant either in hypertensive or non-hypertensive groups.

[31055733_sent_1] Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the interplay of multiple genetic and non-genetic factors.

Question: What are the findings from genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's?

Scientific Answer (with citations): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted to identify genetic markers associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have yielded several notable results. These studies typically involve comparing the genomes of individuals affected by AD against those without the disease to find variations that may be linked to its development. In a recent study involving 71,880 AD patients and 383,378 control subjects, researchers found significant associations of 15 novel polymorphisms outside the chromosome 19q13 region, which were observed across both hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups. This suggests that these regions might harbor genes important for AD susceptibility but not necessarily related to hypertension. Additionally, the IGAP consortium has been instrumental in identifying the genetic landscape of AD, highlighting the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in this neurodegenerative condition.
