❓ QUERY: What is the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and Alzheimer's disease genetics?
======================================================================

💡 ANSWER:
[30413934_sent_1] Cardiovascular (CV)- and lifestyle-associated risk factors (RFs) are increasingly recognized as important for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. [31055733_sent_1] Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heritable and recent studies have identified over 20 disease-associated genomic loci. [30413934_sent_10] We pinpoint a subset of cardiovascular-associated genes that strongly increase the risk for AD.

❓ QUERY: How does hypertension influence the genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease?
======================================================================

💡 ANSWER:
[31055733_sent_2] Hypertension is one of the AD risk factors that has been linked to underlying pathological changes like senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation as well as hippocampal atrophy. [30979435_sent_1] The risk of APOE for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is modified by age.

❓ QUERY: Which chromosomal regions contain novel AD risk loci identified in recent GWAS?
======================================================================

💡 ANSWER:
[31055733_sent_8] The chromosomal regions corresponding to four genes (i.e., 2p13.1, 9p13.3, 17q12, and 18q21.1) were not associated with AD at P  5E-06 in previous GWAS. [31055733_sent_4] Our genome-wide association analyses revealed significant associations of 15 novel potentially AD-associated polymorphisms (P  5E-06) that were located outside the chromosome 19q13 region and were significant either in hypertensive or non-hypertensive groups. [31055733_sent_6] Also, four of them were located within two chromosomal regions (i.e., 3q13.11 and 17q21.2) that were not associated with AD at P  5E-06 before. [30448613_sent_2] The identified and/or confirmed 19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AD are located on non-coding DNA regions, and their functional impacts on AD are as yet poorly understood.

❓ QUERY: How does plasma lipid profile contribute to AD genetic risk beyond APOE?
======================================================================

💡 ANSWER:
[30413934_sent_4] In fold enrichment plots, we observed robust genetic enrichment in AD as a function of plasma lipids (TG, TC, LDL, and HDL); we found minimal AD genetic enrichment conditional on BMI, T2D, CAD, and WHR. [30413934_sent_5] Beyond APOE, at conjunction FDR  0.05 we identified 90 SNPs on 19 different chromosomes that were jointly associated with AD and CV-associated outcomes.

❓ QUERY: What is AD-by-proxy and how does it correlate with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease?
======================================================================

💡 ANSWER:
[30617256_sent_4] AD-by-proxy, based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD (rg = 0.81). [30617256_sent_3] Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). [31055733_sent_1] Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the interplay of multiple genetic and non-genetic factors.
