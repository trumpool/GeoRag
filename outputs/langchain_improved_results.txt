❓ QUERY: How does hypertension affect Alzheimer's disease risk?
======================================================================

💡 ANSWER:
Hypertension is one of the AD risk factors that has been linked to underlying pathological changes like senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation as well as hippocampal atrophy.

❓ QUERY: What is the role of APOE and other genes in Alzheimer's pathology?
======================================================================

💡 ANSWER:
[Source_A] APOE 4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. [Source_B] The 4 allele increases disease risk in the brain. [Source_C]

❓ QUERY: What are the findings from genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's?
======================================================================

💡 ANSWER:
[30617256_sent_3] Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). [30448613_sent_1] The International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) is a consortium for characterizing the genetic landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
